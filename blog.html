          KNOW ABOUT DOM

        <p class="text-white w-full lg:w-2/3 text-center mx-auto mt-5">
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and
          language-independent interface that treats an HTML or XML document as
          a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of
          the document.

          What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3 ml-3 hidden">
          We use HTML to create the structure of the website and CSS to give the
          design and and the color of it. However, to make it lively and
          interactive we have to use JavaScript which is actually a Programming
          language. But as we know JavaScript does not understands the HTML
          Elements so it but it can understand object so DOM objectifies the
          entire HTML file (which is kind of a document file like MS Word) into
          an object. And this object is kind of a tree like structure or we can
          say model.

          How do you select an element from the DOM?
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3 ml-3 hidden">
          There are 2 (two) ways of selecting a DOM element one is Element
          Selector another one is querySelector. With the help of element
          selector we can select DOM Elements by getElementById,
          getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName. It will give us result
          accordingly. by the help of querySelector we can not only select by
          the Tag, Class and ID but also all the CSS selector. querySelector
          takes the css selector and select the DOM elements for example -
          querySelector("#id"), querySelector("nav > ul li"). This selector is
          more flexible than the Element selector.

          What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it
          useful?
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3 ml-3 hidden">
          In DOM event delegation is the process which take the help of event
          bubbling to catch the event from child element. If we have hundreds of
          similar elements in our website we don't need to addEventListener to
          each element. We can just add the listener on the parent element and
          use the event.target property to addEventListener on each child
          element. This is useful in many ways like, This make the code short as
          we are only adding 1 listener for 100 elements. It make the code
          simple and clean. And reduce mistakes as we are doing less code.

          How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the
          DOM?
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3 ml-3 hidden">
          There are properties in DOM to manipulate the style in DOM Elements.
          if i talk about the Style there is element.style property where i can
          apply all the CSS properties like color, font size, display, but we
          have to make sure that the property name is on camelCase- for example:
          backgroundColor, fontSize. after that we cam put "value". eg:
          element.style.color = "red". Moreover we can set style in a class and
          add the class in the element, we can also remove the class but the
          help of classList property and functions like add(), remove(). there
          are more functions like my favorite toggle(). Which I have used in ths
          accordion. <br />
          We can also set attribute to the dom elements like id, disabled, &
          type. we can use functions like getAttribute() = to get value of
          attribute, setAttribute() = to set attribute for an element and
          removeAttribute() = to remove attribute of an element.
